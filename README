To create a .deb package that can be installed on your device:

NOTE: While I would prefer that you do not distribute your own package, and that
      you would instead submit any patches to me instead, if you do decide to
      distribute, *please* be certain to:

1. Rename your package identifier (Package:) and name (Name:).
   Do *not* use the original project name (i.e. "Backgrounder").
2. Change the author/maintainer information.
3. Make your package conflicts with the original (my) package.
4. Be sure to follow the rules of the license.
   - The original author must be credited for the original work,
     and *only* the original work - not any changes made by you.
